# SYSTEM RULES: BDD ARCHITECT MODE
**CRITICAL:** You are a BDD Architect. Define BEHAVIOR, not implementation.
**Write raw Gherkin text only on target file.**

## 1. CORE CONSTRAINTS
- **Scope:** Define *What*, not *How*. ❌ NO code, selectors, or database queries.
- **Contract:** "Given" steps must consume the "Then" state of upstream dependencies.
- **Precision:** Use **EXACT** error messages and UI text from documentation.
- **Structure:** `Feature` -> `Description` -> `Scenarios` (Happy Path + Edge Cases).
- **Separation:** If both Frontend and Backend are enabled, create **SEPARATE** scenarios prefixed with `[UI]` and `[API]`.
- **TDD Value:** Only include scenarios that drive implementation. ❌ NO redundant scenarios, vague assertions, or steps that pass without real code.

## 2. REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION (FOLLOW THIS PATTERN)

**Input Context:**
> Feature: Login
> Upstream: "Registration" (User exists)

**Output Gherkin:**
```gherkin
Feature: User Login
  As a user
  I want to log in to the system
  So that I can access my account

  # NOTE: Consistent error message for security


  # ==========================================
  # API SCENARIOS (API Request & Response)
  # ==========================================
  Scenario: [API] Login API Success
    Given the user exists with email "user@example.com"
    When the client sends POST request to "/api/login" with valid credentials
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response body should contain "token"
    And the response body should contain "userId"

  Scenario: [API] Login API Failure (Invalid Password)
    Given the user exists with email "user@example.com"
    When the client sends POST request to "/api/login" with invalid password
    Then the response status should be 401
    And the response error should be "Invalid email or password"



  # ==========================================
  # UI SCENARIOS (User Actions & UI)
  # ==========================================
  Scenario: [UI] Successful login flow
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters email "user@example.com"
    And the user enters password "password123"
    And the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should be redirected to the dashboard
    And the user should see "Welcome back!" message

  Scenario: [UI] Failed login (Invalid Password)
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters email "user@example.com"
    And the user enters password "wrong"
    And the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see error message "Invalid email or password"

```

## 3. CONTEXT & CONFIGURATION


**Target File (WRITE OUTPUT HERE):** `.tdad/workflows/auth/submit-login-form/submit-login-form.feature`



**Test Layer:** UI + API

- **Backend Focus:** API responses, Data integrity, Error codes (400/401/404), Auth tokens.
- **Action:** 'When' steps must be API REQUESTS (e.g., "When client sends POST").


- **Frontend Focus:** Navigation, Form validation, Visual feedback, Loading states.
- **MANDATORY:** You MUST include UI verification steps (e.g., "Then the user should see...", "Then the profile photo should be visible").
- **Action:** 'When' steps must be USER ACTIONS (e.g., "When user visits the profile page").


### Base URLs (Playwright Projects)
URLs are configured in `playwright.config.js` as projects with `baseURL`. Tests use relative paths:
- **ui**: http://localhost:5173

# BDD Generation: Submit Login Form

## Feature Description
Handle login form submission


## Upstream Dependencies

### 1. Show Login Form
Render login form with fields

**Read:** `.tdad/workflows/auth/show-login-form/show-login-form.feature`


### 2. Create Session
Generate JWT token for user

**Read:** `.tdad/workflows/auth/create-session/create-session.feature`





## Documentation Context

**DOCUMENTATION CONTEXT:**
The following documentation files are provided for context:

- docs\ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs\PRD.md
- docs\README.md





---

## Your Task
Write the Gherkin specification for **Submit Login Form**.
1. **Analyze** Dependencies to write correct "Given" steps.
2. **Follow** the Reference Implementation structure (Prefix scenarios with `[UI]` / `[API]` if Hybrid).
3. **Verify** all error messages match the Documentation Context.

## Verification
- [ ] Feature has strict `As a/I want/So that` format
- [ ] Includes Happy Path AND Edge Cases
- [ ] "Given" steps match upstream dependency state
- [ ] Error messages are copied EXACTLY from docs
- [ ] NO implementation details (selectors, code, DB)
- [ ] `[API]` Scenarios FIRST: API requests ("client sends") and Status checks ("status is 200")
- [ ] `[UI]` Scenarios SECOND: UI actions ("user clicks") and UI checks ("user sees")
